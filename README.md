# Project Proposal: Crowdsourced Local Event Finder Web App
________________________________________
## Problem Statement
It can be difficult to find local events that fit with one's interests in the fast-paced world of today. Conventional event discovery tools frequently don't use community-driven information, don't offer personalized recommendations, and don't have a hyper-local focus. Due to their low exposure, smaller or more specialized events—like pop-up markets, neighbourhood gatherings, or local art exhibits—frequently go missed. Users also have trouble locating trustworthy, first-hand evaluations and suggestions to help them decide whether or not to attend events. This market gap emphasizes the need for a platform that integrates community-driven ratings, geolocation technology, and personalized event discovery to give users a more customized and interesting experience.

1.	Uses geolocation technology to make it easy for users to find events in their area. 
2.	Provides a dependable and interesting platform for event discovery by enabling the community to submit, rate, and review events. 
3.	Offers tailored suggestions according on user inclinations and previous exchanges.
